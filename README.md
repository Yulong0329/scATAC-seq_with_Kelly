Comparative Analysis of Two Peak Calling Strategies in Single-Cell ATAC-seq

This repository contains the full analysis code and data processing scripts for my master's thesis project, which compares two peak calling strategiesâ€”by-sample and all-sampleâ€”in single-cell ATAC-seq data from colorectal cancer samples.

ðŸ§ª Project Overview

The project systematically compares the impact of two peak calling strategies on:

Peak length distribution
Overlap with known regulatory elements (promoters and enhancers)
Peaks Overlap Comparison
Downstream analysis outcomes (normalization, clustering, differential accessibility)
